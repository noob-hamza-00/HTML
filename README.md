**Project : Personal Portfolio in html/css**


**Dated : 29-08-24**

Personally developed the whole portfolio of my own using html and css basics, got a strong grip on front end developing by editing the whole project.
In this code if you want to make yout own portfolio to paste on your personal ids like linkedin then first change names and logos and also paste your own personal ids urlss and give your own discription, 
you can surely paste it whereever you want. Its a good animated portfolio and thats it.
